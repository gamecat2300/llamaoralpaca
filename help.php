	The easiest difference to spot is the ears.<br />
	Llamas have long banana-shaped ears while alpacas have shorter spear-shaped ears.<br /><br />
	There really are a lot of differences between llamas and alpacas.<br />
	The llama is roughly twice the size of the alpaca. Most alpacas weigh between 100 and 175 lbs when fully grown.<br /><br />
	Llamas on the other hand weigh in the neighborhood of 200 to 350 lbs. with some as heavy as 400 lbs. and the llama has a very coarse outer coat over a softer inner coat - as opposed to the alpaca, which has a very fine, single coat.<br />
	In addition, the llama produces far less fiber per animal than the alpaca, despite its much larger size.<br /><br />
	This is because the alpaca was domesticated and carefully bred for over 5000 years as a luxury fiber-producing animal. The llama has been bred for the same amount of time as a pack-carrying animal.<br /><br />
